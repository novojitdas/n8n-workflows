I get as excited when I learn something new about dog training today as I did 45 or 50 years ago. For me this journey began as a hobby and has evolved into a life’s passion and work. It will end on the day I die.\\n\\nThere is nothing secretive or magical about training dogs.

The key is to get the right experience.\\n\\nOne only needs to spend a couple of hours searching the internet to understand that there are certainly a lot of people out there who lack experience or are basing their training opinions on poorly acquired experience.\\n\\nDog training does not necessarily have to begin when you buy an 8 week old puppy (although it should) or when your 10 year old dog bites a child. In reality it begins on the day you make up your mind to learn how your dog thinks and relates to the world it lives in. It begins when you decide to relate to your dog in a manner that both you and your dog respect and understand. It begins when you make up your mind to develop a meaningful relationship based on trust, communication and control.\\n\\nAlthough our family had owned dogs my entire life I made this decision to really try and understand dogs when I was in high school. I was 16 years old and it was the 1960’s. I owned a rescue dog named King and thought he was the cat’s meow.\\n\\nWe took 2 or 3 walks in the woods every day. He was my best bud. I had him trained to hand signals and verbal commands. One morning, before school, we came out of the woods and King chased a cat into the road. He would not respond to my calls to stop and COME.

I hope in some\\nsmall way it makes you think and develop or adopt\\nyour own philosophy of how to train your dog.\\n\\nThere are 3 Categories of Dog Trainers\\n\\nThree basic categories of dog trainers which I place\\non a sliding scale.\\n\\nFirst Category\\n\\nThe first category on the left is the group of people\\nwho beg or bribe their dogs to do something by\\noffering a food or toy reward.\\n\\nDon’t get me wrong, I use food and toys in training,\\nbut I also use distractions and corrections.

These dogs end up being pushy, dominant and often antisocial aggressive animals. These are the dogs that are turned into animal shelters as being unmanageable when in fact they act the way they do as a result of ineffective dog training.\\n\\nSecond Category\\n\\nAt the other end of the scale, on the right side, is the second category of dog trainers. These are trainers who intimidate or force their dogs to do what they want (the William Kholer trainers) . I call them the old school “yank and crank” trainers. They put a choke collar on a dog and force it to do everything. Many professional dog trainers use these methods because for them time is money and with enough force a dog can be trained to do almost anything.\\n\\nThe problem with yank and crank trainers is the dogs seldom like their handlers and in fact are often afraid of them. These are the dogs that tuck their tails or lay on the ground when asked to do something.

If you don’t have a good bond with your dog, or if your dog does not respect you as a pack leader, you will never reach consistency in training.\\n\\nThird Category\\n\\nThe third category of dog trainer is the where I want to be. Category three trainers strive to be in the middle of the other two categories. They balance in the middle but are always prepared to move one way or the other depending on what’s going on in their dog training at a given point in time.\\n\\nThe third group uses food, toys or praise to take a dog through a learning phase. This is where the dog actually learns the meaning of a command – for example it learns the meaning of the word “COME”.\\n\\nOnce the dog understands the meaning of the command the trainer then adds distractions to the program. A good example of this is a dog that has learned the meaning of the command “DOWN - STAY” but now must learn to stay when the owner or someone else tosses a ball in front of the dog's feet or drops a hot dog 4 feet from where he is lying.\\n\\nCopyright Leerburg® Enterprises Inc.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The vast majority of pet owners, 99% of them, fail to understand that the driving force in a dog’s life is its desire to maintain harmony in their pack structure. The majority of behavioral problems develop as a result of poor pack structure in the dog's living environment. This is why I tell people that obedience training is only 25% of the solution to correct behavioral problems and 75% of the solution deals with establishing a sound family pack structure.\\n\\nYour dog can love you and not respect you.

With that said he has a responsibility to follow known directions and if he refuses there will be consequences.\\n\\nDogs see life in black and white terms. This means they see life in terms of “things that are good for them” and “things that are not good for them”. They don’t understand English and for the most part they don’t reason; they just react to the black parts of life and the white parts of life.\\n\\nThrough experience gained in training we show the dog that we are only going to ask him to do things he knows how to do. When he does something correctly we always let him know he is doing the right thing and we are happy with him.

We don’t correct because “WE THINK HE KNOWS BETTER.” We only correct because we know, through experience gained in training, that he understands a command and is refusing to do it.\\n\\nThe dog must learn that we are 100% consistent in how and when we administer corrections. Being consistent at all times is one of the most important parts of being a pack leader. For example, we can’t ignore aggressive behavior towards guests in our home and then correct the dog when he wants to be aggressive while on walks.\\n\\nI train protection dogs. My dogs learn that the only time they are allowed to be aggressive is when I tell them it’s OK or when I am attacked. Through training, this becomes clear and is very black and white for the dog.\\n\\nIf you study pack behavior, or even herd behavior, you will see that rank issues in the pack are often dealt with very subtly or passively but disrespect is dealt with very quickly and aggressively. The same thing needs to happen in a relationship with a dog. For a correction to be effective it must be administered within 1 ½ seconds of an infraction not an hour after the dog peed on the floor.\\n\\nWhen I hear people say “He knows he did something wrong while I was gone,” I shake my head and feel sorry for that poor dog.\\n\\nCopyright Leerburg® Enterprises Inc.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This means that the handler must learn when simply saying “NO” is enough of a correction to let the dog know that he is doing something wrong vs. learning when to administer a level 10 leash correction. (e.g. showing aggression to a child)\\n\\nOne of the most difficult things for new trainers to learn is when to administer a correction, what type of correction to administer and how hard that correction should be. I wrote an article titled THE THEORY OF CORRECTIONS IN DOG TRAINING, I recommend that all new dog trainers read this article.\\n\\nNew dog trainers need to remember that a dog learns through repetition. It often takes 30 repetitions for a dog to learn a new command. Trainers are often guilty of thinking their dog understands a command when in fact they have not repeated an exercise often enough for a dog to completely understand that exercise. This results in owners unjustly correcting their dogs for something the dog does not understand.

We see this frequently in training classes which only focus on positive training methods while ignoring distractions and corrections. (i.e. classes that only use clickers and head halters like those at PetSmart or PETCO), Don’t get me wrong, I like using clickers. I train with them and markers (rather than a clicker I will use my voice and say “OK “). You can read the article I wrote on my web site about training with markers.\\n\\nThe difference between what I do and what these ineffective obedience classes do is that once the dog has learned an exercise with markers I add distractions.\\n\\nWhen the distraction becomes so high that it promotes disobedience I correct the dog.\\n\\nMy philosophy is the only way to get consistency in training and ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU DIFFERENTLY LACKS EXPERIENCE.\\n\\nOn the other end of the scale we find professional dog trainers who take in customer’s dogs for training. The vast majority of these trainers use far too much force. I have already said “time is money” to these people and they can force a dog into submission a lot quicker than they can take it through a learning phase that uses markers.\\n\\nCopyright Leerburg® Enterprises Inc.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Today clickers and head halters with no corrections are the fad. This fad is wrong and is playing itself out in the dog world because we see an explosion of dominance and aggressive dog problems in family pets.\\n\\nOnce again, the correct position is in the middle. The difference between a good trainer and a great trainer is that the great trainer will always maintain balance point between motivation and correction.\\n\\nRespect - Cooperate - Try\\n\\nI tell people my dog should respect me, cooperate and try to do what I ask.
